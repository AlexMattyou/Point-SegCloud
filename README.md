# Point-SegCloud 🌐

Point-SegCloud is a GUI-based software developed in C++ for researchers working with aerial point cloud data. It enables segmentation of point clouds, extraction of features, and storage of segmented data into separate files, allowing detailed data analysis.

## ✨ Features

- **📌 Point Cloud Segmentation** – Automatically segments aerial point cloud data into distinct components.
- **📊 Feature Extraction** – Extracts meaningful features from the segmented data for research and analysis.
- **📁 Data Export** – Saves segmented data and extracted features into separate files for further processing.
- **🖥️ Easy-to-Use GUI** – Provides an interactive user interface for efficient workflow.

## 📥 Download & Installation

1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases](https://github.com/AlexMattyou/Point-SegCloud/releases) page.
2. **Run the MSI Installer** and follow the on-screen instructions to install the software.
3. **Launch Point-SegCloud** and start working with point cloud data.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Load Point Cloud Data**  
   - Open the software and use the ‘Open File’ option to load your aerial point cloud dataset.

2. **Segment Point Cloud**  
   - Utilize segmentation tools in the GUI to divide the point cloud into meaningful components.

3. **Extract Features**  
   - Apply built-in feature extraction algorithms to analyze the segmented data.

4. **Export Data**  
   - Save the segmented data and extracted features in separate files for further research and processing.
